            <blockquote>It didn’t take long for the commercial Web’s pioneers to learn that the slogan “If you build it, they will come“
                was a hollow joke: You have to build it well, thoughtfully and ambitiously and inventively, and then you
                have to keep rethinking it and rebuilding it, if you have any hope of attracting a crowd.

            <p>The first step in designing any web site is to define your goals. Without a clearly stated mission and objectives,
                the project will drift, bog down, or continue past an appropriate endpoint. Careful planning and a clear
                purpose are the keys to success in building web sites, particularly when you are working as part of a development
                team.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Planning a web site is a two-part process: first you gather your development team, analyze your needs and goals,
                and work through the development process outlined here to refine your plans. Next you create a project charter
                document that details what you intend to do and why, what technology and content you’ll need, how long the
                process will take, what you will spend to do it, and how you will assess the results of your efforts. The
                project charter document is crucial to creating a successful site: it is both the blueprint for your process
                and the touchstone you’ll use to keep the project focused on the agreed-on goals and deliverables.</p>

            <p>Usability is a measure of effectiveness. It describes how effective tools and information sources are in helping
                us accomplish tasks. The more usable the tool, the better we are able to achieve our goals. Many tools help
                us overcome physical limitations by making us stronger, faster, and more sharp-sighted. But tools can be
                frustrating or even disabling. When we encounter a tool that we cannot work with, either because it is poorly
                designed or because its design does not take into account our needs, we are limited in what we can accomplish.</p>

            <p>In designing web sites our job is to reduce functional limitations through design. When we aim for
                <em>universal</em> usability, we improve the quality of life for more people more of the time. On the web, we
                can work toward universal usability by adopting a universal design approach to usability.</p>
