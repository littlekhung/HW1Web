            <blockquote>It didn’t take long for the commercial Web’s pioneers to learn that the slogan “If you build it, they will come“
                was a hollow joke: You have to build it well, thoughtfully and ambitiously and inventively, and then you
                have to keep rethinking it and rebuilding it, if you have any hope of attracting a crowd.

            <p>The first step in designing any web site is to define your goals. Without a clearly stated mission and objectives,
                the project will drift, bog down, or continue past an appropriate endpoint. Careful planning and a clear
                purpose are the keys to success in building web sites, particularly when you are working as part of a development
                team.
            </p>

            <p>Planning a web site is a two-part process: first you gather your development team, analyze your needs and goals,
                and work through the development process outlined here to refine your plans. Next you create a project charter
                document that details what you intend to do and why, what technology and content you’ll need, how long the
                process will take, what you will spend to do it, and how you will assess the results of your efforts. The
                project charter document is crucial to creating a successful site: it is both the blueprint for your process
                and the touchstone you’ll use to keep the project focused on the agreed-on goals and deliverables.</p>

            <blockquote>
                To err is human, to forgive—design.
                <br> —Andrew Dillon

            <p>Usability is a measure of effectiveness. It describes how effective tools and information sources are in helping
                us accomplish tasks. The more usable the tool, the better we are able to achieve our goals. Many tools help
                us overcome physical limitations by making us stronger, faster, and more sharp-sighted. But tools can be
                frustrating or even disabling. When we encounter a tool that we cannot work with, either because it is poorly
                designed or because its design does not take into account our needs, we are limited in what we can accomplish.</p>

            <p>In designing web sites our job is to reduce functional limitations through design. When we aim for
                <em>universal</em> usability, we improve the quality of life for more people more of the time. On the web, we
                can work toward universal usability by adopting a universal design approach to usability.</p>

            <p>Here we cover the concepts, principles, and processes for universal usability. Specific techniques for universal
                usability are woven into context in the chapters that follow.</p>

            <p>In the context of web site design, information architecture describes the overall conceptual models and general
                designs used to plan, structure, and assemble a site. Every web site has an information architecture, but
                information architecture techniques are particularly important to large, complex web sites, where the primary
                aims are to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Organize the site content into taxonomies and hierarchies of information;</li>
                <li>Communicate conceptual overviews and the overall site organization to the design team and clients;</li>
                <li>Research and design the core site navigation concepts;</li>
                <li>Set standards and specifications for the handling of
                    <span class="smallcaps">html</span> semantic markup, and the format and handling of text content; and</li>
                <li>Design and implement search optimization standards and strategies.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Information architecture encompasses a broad range of design and planning disciplines, and the boundaries among
                information architecture, technical design, user interface, and graphic design are necessarily blurred by
                the need for all of these communities of practice to cooperate to produce a cohesive, coherent, and consistent
                experience for the site user. Architecture is an appropriate metaphor for the assembling of complex multidimensional
                information spaces shared by many different users and readers, where the underlying structure of information
                must first be framed out before more specific disciplines such as interface and graphic design can operate
                effectively. The user interface and visual design of the site may be much more visible to the user initially,
                but if the underlying organization of the site and its content is poorly constructed, visual or interactive
                design will not fix the problems.</p>

            <p>In large web projects the role of information architect will probably be filled by an individual with long experience
                in organizing and presenting information, particularly in the context of the web. However, in many projects
                the information architecture of the site will become a joint project among the design, editorial, and technical
                teams. Regardless of how the role is filled, the information architecture tasks form the crucial planning
                bridge between your general discussions of site goals and audiences and the specific design, user interface,
                and technical solutions you’ll use in the finished site designs.</p>

                <em>feature</em> of a web site, it
                <em>is</em> the web site, in the same way that the building, the shelves, and the cash registers

            <p>Users of web documents don’t just look at information, they interact with it in novel ways that have no precedents
                in paper document design; therefore, web designers must be versed in the art and science of interface design.
                The graphic user interface (
                <span class="smallcaps">gui</span>) of a computer system comprises the interaction metaphors, images, and concepts used to convey
                function and meaning on the computer screen. It also includes the detailed visual characteristics of every
                component of the graphic interface and the functional sequence of interactions over time that produce the
                characteristic look and feel of web pages. Graphic design and visual “signature” graphics are not used simply
                to enliven web pages—graphics are integral to the user’s experience with your site. In interactive documents,
                graphic design cannot be separated from issues of interface design.</p>

            <p>Much as foundational concrete and piles define the stability and longevity of buildings, so the structural underpinnings
                of web sites affect their success in ways that, though not visible on the surface, are ultimately far more
                important than color and typography. Site structure determines how well sites work in the broader context
                of the web. </p>

            <p>The methods you use to mark up pages determine whether they can be read well by software and indexed well by
                search engines. The logic and stability of the underlying files and directories that your web site rests
                on affect its functionality, as well as its potential for growth and expansion. </p>

            <p>Attention to these behind-the-scenes structural components from the start produces a web site that will hold
                up over time, work effectively within the larger web environment, and adapt and grow as needed.</p>

                The experienced web designer, like the talented newspaper art director, accepts that many projects she works on will have
                headers and columns and footers. Her job is not to whine about emerging commonalities but to use them to
                create pages that are distinctive, natural, brand-appropriate, subtly memorable, and quietly but unmistakably
                engaging.

            <p>Book design and print typography are ancient and well-respected design disciplines. Both have a long tradition
                of creativity within the tight boundaries of our expectations for the form of books, page layout, letterform
                design, typography, and the harmonious confluence of visual design and content that characterizes the best
                print design. These deeply creative and intellectually demanding crafts are not hobbled by the 950 pages
                of rules and conventions in
                <cite>The Chicago Manual of Style</cite>. </p>

            <p>Book design, typography, and the larger world of print publishing are
                <em>enabled</em> by established conventions and standards for print publication. With “web standards” methods
                for building sites, with carefully validated and universally accessible
                <span class="smallcaps">xhtml</span> and
                <span class="smallcaps">css</span>, we now have excellent technical standards. Unfortunately we’re still in an awkward, adolescent
                stage for web publishing, editorial, and design standards, but clear patterns and user expectations are emerging
                from the chaos.</p>

            <p>It may seem odd to start a chapter on “design” with a plea for standards, rules, and conventions, but often site
                projects founder in the design stage because the larger norms of traditional publishing, editorial standards,
                and institutional practices are ignored in the pursuit of graphic, technical, or interactive eccentricities.
                “Prefer the standard to the offbeat.” Take this timeless advice from William Strunk and E. B. White, and
                save your creative chops for the
                <em>real</em> work of developing interesting content.</p>

                Simplicity is not the goal. It is the by-product of a good idea and modest expectations.

            <p>We seek clarity, order, and trustworthiness in information sources, whether traditional paper documents or web
                pages. Effective page design can provide this confidence. The spatial organization of graphics and text on
                the web page can engage users with graphic impact, direct their attention, prioritize the information they
                see, and make their interactions with your web site more enjoyable and efficient.</p>

            <p>Design creates visual logic and seeks an optimal balance between visual sensation and graphic information. Without
                the visual impact of shape, color, and contrast, pages are graphically uninteresting and will not motivate
                the viewer. Dense text documents without contrast and visual relief are also hard to read, particularly on
                low-resolution screens. But without the depth and complexity of text, highly graphic pages risk disappointing
                the user by offering a poor balance of visual sensation, text information, and interaction. In seeking the
                ideal balance, the primary constraints for page design are the limitations of the web medium, the diversity
                of individuals and technologies accessing web pages, and access speeds ranging from slow modems to high-speed
                wired and wireless connections.</p>

            <p>Visual and functional continuity in your web site organization, graphic design, and typography are essential
                to convince your audience that your web site offers them timely, accurate, and useful information. A careful,
                systematic approach to page design can simplify navigation, reduce user errors, and make it easier for users
                to take advantage of the information and features of the site. But given the wide and diverse range of contexts
                that make up the experience of the web, the starting point for web page design begins under the surface of
                the page, with the structure of the underlying code.</p>

            <p>Typography is the balance and interplay of letterforms on the page—a verbal and visual equation that helps the
                reader understand the form and absorb the substance of the page content. Typography plays a dual role as
                both verbal and visual communication. When readers scan a page they are subconsciously aware of both functions:
                first they survey the overall graphic patterns of the page, and then they parse the language and read. </p>

            <p>Good typography establishes a visual hierarchy for rendering prose on the page by providing visual punctuation
                and graphic accents that help readers understand relations between prose and pictures, headlines and subordinate
                blocks of text.</p>

            <p>People read differently on the web, and a new writing genre designed to accommodate the reading habits of online
                users has emerged. Given the low resolution of the computer screen and the awkwardness of the scrolling page,
                many users find reading on-screen uncomfortable, and so they scan on-screen text and print pages for reading.
            </p>

            <p>Web reading is also not a stationary activity. Users roam from page to page, collecting salient bits of information
                from a variety of sources. They scan the contents of a page, get the information, and move on. Web reading
                may also be disorienting because web pages, unlike book or magazine pages, can be accessed directly without
                preamble.
            </p>

            <p>Too often web pages end up as isolated fragments of information, divorced from the larger context of their parent
                sites through the lack of essential links and the failure to inform the user of their contents.</p>

            <p>Web authors use hypertext links to create or supplement concepts: a list of related links can reinforce their
                content or even serve as the focus of their site. The problem posed by links has little to do with the web
                but is rooted in the concept of hypertext: Can the quick juxtaposition of two separate but conceptually related
                pieces of information encourage a better understanding of the message? </p>

            <p>A collection of links cannot create or sustain an argument or deliver a collection of facts as efficiently or
                legibly as conventional linear prose. When there is no sustained narrative, users are sent aimlessly wandering
                in their quest for information. Links also become a maintenance issue, because most web pages are ephemeral.
                Broken links shake the user’s confidence in the validity and timeliness of content. Links should be used
                sparingly and never as a substitute for real content.</p>

            <p>Web interaction today has moved beyond clicking hyperlinks and completing form fields to working with full-blown
                web applications that provide a range of interactivity, including inline editing and drag-and-drop file management.
                The web has become a two-way street, with users as both consumers and active participants. </p>

            <p>And as users take a more active role in web interactions, so demand increases for more dynamic graphical user
                interfaces. In some ways, we are in the same phase with web interaction as we were with visual design a few
                years ago: working around the limitations of the web environment by introducing new technologies and practices
                that, though not universally supported and usable, allow for better methods for designing more usable interfaces.
                And users have come to expect a certain level of sophistication in web interaction, greeting simple, link-driven
                interaction designs with the same scorn as with first-generation, text-only web pages.</p>

            <p>We hope the coming years will bring the same technology growth and stabilization as we have enjoyed in the area
                of visual design, which produced web standards, accessibility, and the separation of content and presentation

                web forms and applications, with more advanced scripting serving only as an enhancement to standard modes
                of interaction.</p>

            <p>Good diagrams and interesting illustrations are visually arresting and create documents that are distinct and

            <p>Our limits are now fewer and our tools are more powerful, but we still have to answer the same questions communicators
